T’AU EMPIRE
ARMY RULE
The Hunter Cadres battle for the betterment of
the T’au Empire, not for personal gain or egotistic
accomplishments. This burning commitment allows
for prodigiously effective covering fire. Enemies are
pinned in place by deadly bursts of pulse blasts,
or the infamous T’au markerlight is used to expose
even well-fortified enemy positions, allowing other
T’au warriors to fall on the vulnerable enemies with
murderous force.
FOR THE GREATER GOOD
If your Army Faction is T’au Empire, then in your
Shooting phase units from your army can work in
pairs to help each other target specific enemy units.
When they do this, one unit is the Observer unit and
the other is their Guided unit. The enemy they are
targeting is called their Spotted unit.
Each time you select this unit to shoot, if it is not an
Observer unit, it can use this ability. If it does, select
one other friendly unit with this ability that is also
eligible to shoot (excluding Fortification, Battleshocked and Observer units). Until the end of
the phase, this unit is considered a Guided
unit, and that friendly unit is considered an
Observer unit. Then select one enemy unit
that is visible to both your units to be their
Spotted unit.
Until the end of the phase:
■ Each time a model in a Guided unit makes
an attack that targets their Spotted unit,
improve the Ballistic Skill characteristic of
the attack by 1 and, if their Observer unit
has the Markerlight keyword, the attack
has the [IGNORES COVER] ability.
■ Each time a model in a Guided unit makes an
attack that does not target their Spotted unit,
worsen the Ballistic Skill characteristic of the attack
by 1.
T’AU EMPIRE – KAUYON
DETACHMENT RULE
If your Army Faction is T’au Empire, you can use this
Kauyon Detachment rule.
RESTRICTIONS
■ If your army includes any Ethereal units, it cannot
include a Commander Farsight model.
■ If your army includes a Commander Farsight
model, it cannot include any Ethereal units.
KAUYON
The tactical philosophy known as the Kauyon allows
for T’au commanders to draw the enemy into a deadly
trap, springing it at the prefect moment to deliver a
storm of fatal strikes against which none can escape.
From the third battle round onwards, all ranged
weapons equipped by T’au Empire models from your
army have the [SUSTAINED HITS 1] ability. While a unit is
a Guided unit (see For the Greater Good), weapons in
that unit have the [SUSTAINED HITS 2] ability instead.
T’AU EMPIRE – KAUYON
STRATAGEMS
If you are using the Kauyon Detachment rule, you can use these Kauyon Stratagems.
STIMM INJECTORS
KAUYON – WARGEAR STRATAGEM
This system injects the battlesuit pilot with
a measured dose of chemical stimulants
intended to temporarily accelerate their
physical aptitude and pain tolerances.
WHEN: Fight phase or your opponent’s
Shooting phase, just after an enemy unit
has selected its targets.
TARGET: One T’au Empire Battlesuit
unit from your army that was selected as
the target of one or more of the attacking
unit’s attacks.
EFFECT: Until the end of the phase,
models in your unit have the
Feel No Pain 6+ ability.
STRIKE AND FADE
KAUYON – STRATEGIC PLOY STRATAGEM
T’au are experts at harrying and
outmanoeuvring their foes, bleeding them
with accurate fire before fading away into
the shadows and luring the foe into a trap.
WHEN: Your Shooting phase.
TARGET: One T’au Empire Battlesuit
unit from your army that can Fly whose
attacks have been resolved this phase.
EFFECT: If your unit is not within
Engagement Range of any enemy units, it
can make a Normal move. If it does, your
unit cannot declare a charge this turn.
COORDINATE TO ENGAGE
KAUYON – BATTLE TACTIC STRATAGEM
T’au combined arms groups are called
Hunter Cadres for good reason. Working in
close coordination, they hunt and destroy
the most dangerous enemy targets.
WHEN: Your Shooting phase.
TARGET: One T’au Empire unit from your
army that has just been selected as an
Observer unit (see For the Greater Good).
EFFECT: Until the end of the phase, each
time a model in your unit makes an attack
that targets their Spotted unit, improve
the Ballistic Skill characteristic of that
attack by 1 and, if your unit has the
Markerlight keyword, that attack has
the [IGNORES COVER] ability.
POINT-BLANK AMBUSH
KAUYON – BATTLE TACTIC STRATAGEM
The Kauyon teaches to lure the enemy
into deadly point-blank ambushes.
WHEN: Your Shooting phase.
TARGET: One T’au Empire unit from your
army that has not been selected to shoot
this phase.
EFFECT: Until the end of the phase, each
time a model in your unit makes a ranged
attack that targets an enemy unit within
9", improve the Armour Penetration
characteristic of that attack by 1.
RESTRICTIONS: You cannot use this
Stratagem during the first or second
battle rounds.
1CP
2CP

1CP
T’AU EMPIRE – KAUYON
STRATAGEMS
If you are using the Kauyon Detachment rule, you can use these Kauyon Stratagems.
PHOTON GRENADES
KAUYON – WARGEAR STRATAGEM
Hurling a volley of photon grenades, the
T’au leave their enemies dazzled and
disorientated, unable to close the distance
into combat at a crucial moment.
WHEN: Your opponent’s Charge phase,
just after an enemy unit has declared
a charge.
TARGET: One T’au Empire Grenades unit
from your army that was selected as one
of the targets of that charge.
EFFECT:That enemy unit must
immediately take a Battle-shock test, and
until the end of the phase, subtract 2 from
Charge rolls made for that enemy unit.
COMBAT EMBARKATION
KAUYON – STRATEGIC PLOY STRATAGEM
Those who act as the lure in the
Kauyon must be ready to make a hasty
withdrawal once the enemy closes into
killing range, lest they be trapped.
WHEN: Your opponent’s Charge phase,
just after an enemy unit has declared
a charge.
TARGET: One T’au Empire Infantry unit
from your army that was selected as one
of the targets of that charge, and one
friendly Transport.
EFFECT: Your unit can embark within that
Transport. If it does, your opponent can
select new targets for that charge.
RESTRICTIONS: Every model in your T’au
Empire Infantry unit must be within
3" of that Transport and there must be
sufficient transport capacity to embark
the entire unit.
2CP 1 1CP
If you are using the Kauyon Detachment rule, you can use these Kauyon Enhancements.
EXEMPLAR OF THE KAUYON
Long meditation upon the tenets of the Patient Hunter
has seen this warrior master the application of this
cunning ambush strategy. When they take to the
battlefield, they embody the teachings of the Kauyon,
much to the dismay of their luckless prey.
T’au Empire model only (excluding Kroot Shaper
models). While the bearer is leading a unit, that unit’s
Kauyon Detachment rule takes effect from the second
battle round onwards instead of the third.
PRECISION OF THE PATIENT HUNTER
This warrior prowls the battlefield like a high-tech
predator, stalking and assessing their quarry before
they strike. When they do launch their assault,
their every shot and blow is informed by careful
observations, perfectly aimed where they will do the
greatest harm.
T’au Empire model only. Each time the bearer makes
a ranged attack, add 1 to the Hit roll. From the third
battle round onwards, add 1 to the Wound roll as well.
PURETIDE ENGRAM NEUROCHIP
Commander Puretide was undoubtedly the most
gifted T’au war leader of all time. The T’au were
unwilling to lose his tactical and strategic brilliance,
and upon his death, his mind was scanned and his
accumulated memories committed to a holostorage
personality unit on his birth world of Dal’yth. A sliver
of that genius has been crafted into a neurochip.
When surgically implanted into the brain of a Fire
Caste Commander, the bearer can access much of
the wisdom of Puretide himself, drawing upon a great
reservoir of tactical acumen.
T’au Empire model only (excluding Kroot Shaper
models). Once per turn, you can use a Stratagem on
the bearer’s unit, even if you have already used that
Stratagem on a different unit this phase.
THROUGH UNITY, DEVASTATION
Having studied every nuance of the art of applied
mass-firepower, this warrior has mastered its
deployment. Under their calm tutelage and stern
gaze, warriors of the Fire Caste maximise every shot
they fire, creating a blizzard of deadly-accurate
energy that can pick apart even the most heavily
armoured targets.
T’au Empire model only (excluding Kroot Shaper
models). While this model is leading a unit, each
time that unit is an Observer unit, until the end of
the phase, ranged weapons equipped by models in
their Guided unit have the [LETHAL HITS] ability while
targeting their Spotted unit.
